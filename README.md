## Compeition Details

Algorithms challenge from Xeek (StudioX). Link here - [From One to Many: A Generative AI Challenge](https://xeek.ai/challenges/from-one-to-many)

An exmaple of the goal - determine how many ways you can multiply numbers to get a product of 12? For example, 1 * 12, 2 * 6, and so on. This simple example relates to the main question of this challenge. The problem of finding non-unique solutions is a common issue in various fields, including mathematics and geosciences. Generative algorithms offer a new approach to understanding nonuniqueness by generating multiple scenarios that can help uncover fundamental principles. In this challenge, you will work with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) algorithm. Initially designed by McAliley and Li (2021) to explore the nonuniqueness of gravity fields, your goal is to fine-tune this algorithm's hyperparameters to generate outputs that thoroughly explore the possibilities of a simple mathematical function.
